We will be making a `ViewModifier` that applies a cool rainbow gradient background animation. This modifier will easily turn any `Shape`, `Text` or `View` into a colorful experience.

The tools we will be using are:

* **GeometryReader**: A Container `View` that provides access to the parents size and bounds.
* **mask**: A `ViewModifier` that uses another View to only allow the background view to shine thru where the mask has a fill or stroke.

## Making The Gradient

### Color Generation
First we need to make the colors that go into our `LinearGradient`. We can make use of our higher order functions `stride` and `map`.

```swift
let hueColors = stride(from: 0, to: 1, by: 0.01).map {
        Color(hue: $0, saturation: 1, brightness: 1)
    }
```
**Explanation**
Generally hue is specified as an angle in degrees [0˚, 360˚] or radians [0, 2π]. The hue value of `Color` is a bit different because it is normalized so that the maximum value is 1. Knowing this we use stride to generate an array of numbers between [0,1], and then use map to convert the to an array of different `Color`s


### Linear Gradient

Then we use the `hueColors` to create a `LinearGradient`

```swift
LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: hueColors),
               startPoint: .leading,
               endPoint: .trailing)
```

You should see something like this when previewing the gradient

### Masking

Now to create the text and apply it as the mask

```swift
LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: hueColors),
               startPoint: .leading,
               endPoint: .trailing)
        .mask(Text("Rainbow").font(.system(size: 100)))
```

Which looks something like this

</p>



### Making The Modifier

This is great and all but it is not adaptive and it is also not animated. Before we start the animation let us think about what needs to happen to make a perfectly smooth loop. To do that we need to know the width of the mask. Let's refactor our code into a new ViewModifier and call it `Rainbow`, but this time use a GeometryReader to grab the masks size.


```swift
struct Rainbow: ViewModifier {
    let hueColors = stride(from: 0, to: 1, by: 0.01).map {
        Color(hue: $0, saturation: 1, brightness: 1)
    }

    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .overlay(GeometryReader { (proxy: GeometryProxy) in
                ZStack {
                    LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: self.hueColors),
                                   startPoint: .leading,
                                   endPoint: .trailing)
                        .frame(width: proxy.size.width)
                }
            })
            .mask(content)
    }
}
```

**Explanation**

The masking view is the same as the `content` parameter in the body function.
1. We add `content`
2. Overlay or LinearGradient which is now inside of a `GeometryReader`
3. Modify the `frame` of the gradient to be the same size as the mask
4. Use the content again but this time in the `mask` modifier


**How To Use**

Modifiers are almost always cleaner when using dot syntax to lets make a `ViewExtension` for this modifier

```swift
extension View {
    func rainbow() -> some View {
        self.modifier(Rainbow())
    }
}
```

Then apply it like so:

```swift
Text("Rainbow")
    .font(.system(size: 100))
    .rainbow()
```


### Animating

Copy/paste our `Rainbow` modifier and rename it `RainbowAnimation`. Now we need to think about the geometry we need to make the smooth animation. Basically we need a LinearGradient that is twice the width of our mask with twice the amount of colors. The animation itself should restart when the trailing edge of the gradient reaches the trailing edge of the mask.

**Break Down**

**Animation**

I chose a duration of 4 seconds just because I thought it looked nice, you can experiment with any values you like!

```swift
Animation
      .linear(duration: 4)
      .repeatForever(autoreverses: false)
```

To make the animation play we create a Boolean `State` variable in our modifier called `isOn` and switch its value from false to true when the view appears.


```swift
struct RainbowAnimation: ViewModifier {
    // 1
    @State var isOn: Bool = false
    let hueColors = stride(from: 0, to: 1, by: 0.01).map {
        Color(hue: $0, saturation: 1, brightness: 1)
    }
    // 2
    var duration: Double = 4
    var animation: Animation {
        Animation
            .linear(duration: duration)
            .repeatForever(autoreverses: false)
    }

    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
    // 3
        let gradient = LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: hueColors+hueColors), startPoint: .leading, endPoint: .trailing)
        return content.overlay(GeometryReader { proxy in
            ZStack {
                gradient
    // 4
                    .frame(width: 2*proxy.size.width)
    // 5
                    .offset(x: self.isOn ? -proxy.size.width/2 : proxy.size.width/2)
            }
        })
    // 6
        .onAppear {
            withAnimation(self.animation) {
                self.isOn = true
            }
        }
        .mask(content)
    }
}
```

1. Create the state variable with an initial value of `false`
2. Add our animation
3. Create a gradient with twice the number of colors by adding two of our `hueColors` arrays together
4. Double the width of the gradient
5. Use a ternary operator to change the x offset from its initial position of half the masks width to the right to half the masks width to the left
6. Use the on appear method to change the `isOn` value to true using the animation we made earlier


Finally Make a View Extension for the modifier

```swift
extension View {
    func rainbowAnimation() -> some View {
        self.modifier(RainbowAnimation())
    }
}
```


## Final Thoughts

When using a **stroked** shaped its a good idea to inset the shape by the same value as the line thickness. If you don't the stroke will be cut off due to the fact that the stroke's thickness extends past the shapes bounds.

**Example**

```swift
RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 10)
                    .inset(by: 5)
                    .stroke(Color.black, lineWidth: 5)
                    .frame(width: 300, height: 100)
                    .rainbow()
```
